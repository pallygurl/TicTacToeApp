<center><p class="text1">Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
<br>The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
<br>Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship.
