<br><br>An early variation of tic-tac-toe was played in the Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called Terni Lapilli and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. However, according to some sources, Tic-tac-toe can be traced back to ancient Egypt. <br>Another closely related ancient game is Three Men's Morris which is also played on a simple grid and requires three pieces in a row to finish.</P>
